# Stock-Bulletin-Prediction-Analysis
# Introduction:
This project aims to predict stock prices and analyze stock market data from stock bulletins. Machine learning models are used to forecast stock prices based on features like volume, trade quantity, and market information.

# Dataset Overview:
The datasets contain stock market data with the following features:
- TRADE_DATE: Date of the trade.
- SEC_CODE: Security code of the stock.
- SYMBOL1: Stock symbol.
- MARKET: The market where the stock was traded.
- VOLUME: Trading volume.
- TRADE_QTY: Quantity traded.
- BEST_ASK_PRICE: Best asking price for the stock.
- BEST_BID_PRICE: Best bidding price for the stock.

# Project Objectives:
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare stock market data for analysis.
- Modeling: Implement and compare machine learning models (Linear Regression, KNNR, Decision Tree Regressor) to predict stock prices.
- Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 score.

# Core Components:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends in stock data such as volume, high prices, and low prices.
- Feature Selection: Apply SelectKBest and Sequential methods to improve model performance.
- Modeling: Train and evaluate Linear Regression, KNNR, and Decision Tree Regressor models.

# Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python: Programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- Pandas, NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Scikit-learn: For feature selection and machine learning models.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data visualization.

# Documentation:
- Report: Detailed description of data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluations.
- Jupyter Notebooks: Code for data cleaning, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
- Presentation: Provides an overview of the project, including objectives, methods, and key findings.
